# BreakingRainbow
Scripts for the 'Breaking Rainbow takes a Weekend on a Laptop' paper

We have the following scripts: 

- SimpleAttack.sage: Contains an implementation of the simple attack. Only constructs the \hat{P} system. You can use the block wiedemann XL implementation of Niederhagen to find a solution. http://polycephaly.org/projects/xl
- SimpleAttackRankExp.sage: Script to reproduce tables 2 and 3.
- CombinedAttackRankExp.sage: Script to reproduce table 4.
- SimpleAttackStatistics.sage: Counts how many guesses are good.
- Rainbow.sage: Used by the other scripts to generate a Rainbow public key
